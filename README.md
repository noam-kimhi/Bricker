# 🧱 Java Brick Breaker Game

This project is a **Brick Breaker-style game** developed in **Java** as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming course (67125)** at **The Hebrew University of Jerusalem**.  
It demonstrates strong object-oriented design principles and interactive game mechanics.  
> 🎓 Final Grade: **100**

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

Classic **brick-breaking arcade** mechanics with a modern twist:

- **Control the Paddle**: Use your keyboard to move and deflect the ball.
- **Break Bricks**: Bounce the ball to destroy bricks and score points.
- **Lives System**: You have limited lives, but don’t worry — you can regain them with heart drops!

## 🧩 Power-Ups & Drops

Spice up the game with various in-game drops from broken bricks:

- **🧪 Mock Paddle**  
  Temporarily adds a second paddle for bonus defense.

- **🔥 Turbo Ball**  
  Increases ball speed dramatically for a limited number of hits — watch out!

- **❄️ Puck Ball**  
  Spawns **two balls** instead of one — double the destruction.

- **❤️ Heart Drop**  
  Regain a lost life and extend your play.

- **🎁 Dual Buff**  
  Randomly grants **two** power-ups at once. High risk, high reward!

All buffs are visually indicated and time-bound, requiring players to react quickly and plan strategically.

## 🔧 Additional Features

- 🧱 Dynamic Brick Layouts: Easily customize or extend levels.
- 🧠 Object-Oriented Architecture: Clean class hierarchy for easy extension and readability.
- 🎨 Custom Graphics: Distinct visuals for different power-ups and bricks.
- 🔊 Sound: Sound effects for ball hits, drops, and game events.
